# CNN Example
I have setup a Jupyter notebook to perform a binary classfication task: Identify whether an image is a cat or a dog

This is done in two ways:
1. You build your CNN model from scratch and use it for prediction
2. You use a pre-trained network (VGGNet in this case) and use it to featurize your data. Now instead of training your model on raw image pixels, you train on these features.
